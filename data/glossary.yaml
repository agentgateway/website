Observability (Logging, Monitoring, Tracing):
  short: "Telemetry systems (logs, metrics, traces) used to monitor agentgateway."
  

Proxy:
  short: "Agentgateway-based data plane process that terminates and forwards traffic."
  

Rate Limiting:
  short: "Policies that control request rates to protect backends and enforce quotas."
  

Resiliency:
  short: "Features that improve reliability, such as retries, timeouts, and circuit breakers."
  

Security:
  short: "Authentication, authorization, encryption and other protections for traffic."
  

Traffic Management:
  short: "Features to control routing, transformations, load balancing, and traffic shaping."

Backend:
  short: "A destination service that receives traffic from agentgateway. Backends can be static hosts, MCP servers, LLM providers, or other services."

Listener:
  short: "An entry point for incoming traffic into agentgateway. Listeners are configured on ports and support HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and TLS protocols."

Route:
  short: "A rule that matches incoming requests and forwards them to backends. Routes can match on path, hostname, headers, query parameters, and HTTP methods."

Policy:
  short: "A configuration that manipulates, secures, or observes traffic as it flows through agentgateway. Policies can be attached at the listener, route, or backend level."

Authentication (AuthN):
  short: "The process of verifying the identity of a user or service. Agentgateway supports various authentication methods including JWT, API keys, and basic authentication."

Authorization (AuthZ):
  short: "The process of determining what actions an authenticated user or service is allowed to perform. Agentgateway supports HTTP authorization, MCP authorization, and external authorization services."

JWT (JSON Web Token):
  short: "A compact, URL-safe token format used for securely transmitting information between parties. JWTs are commonly used for authentication and authorization in agentgateway."

API Key:
  short: "A secret token used to authenticate API requests. Agentgateway can validate API keys and attach metadata to authenticated requests."

TLS (Transport Layer Security):
  short: "A cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication over a network. Agentgateway supports TLS for both incoming connections (listeners) and outgoing connections (backends)."

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
  short: "A security mechanism that allows web pages to make requests to a different domain than the one serving the web page. Agentgateway can configure CORS headers to control cross-origin access."

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):
  short: "A security vulnerability where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. Agentgateway can help protect against CSRF attacks."

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
  short: "The protocol used for transmitting web pages and data over the internet. Agentgateway primarily handles HTTP and HTTPS traffic."

HTTPS (HTTP Secure):
  short: "HTTP over TLS/SSL, providing encrypted communication. Agentgateway supports HTTPS listeners with TLS certificate configuration."

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
  short: "A connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered delivery of data. Agentgateway supports TCP listeners for non-HTTP traffic."

Transformation:
  short: "The process of modifying HTTP requests or responses as they pass through agentgateway. Transformations can change headers, body content, and other request/response attributes."

Rewrite:
  short: "A traffic management feature that modifies the authority (host) or path of requests before forwarding them to backends."

Redirect:
  short: "A traffic management feature that sends clients to a different URL, with configurable scheme, authority, path, or status code."

Matching:
  short: "The process of determining which route should handle an incoming request based on criteria such as path, hostname, headers, query parameters, or HTTP methods."

Direct Response:
  short: "A traffic management feature that returns a fixed response (body and status code) directly to the client without forwarding the request to a backend."

Retry:
  short: "A resiliency feature that automatically resends failed requests to backends. Retries can be configured with backoff strategies and specific conditions for when to retry."

Timeout:
  short: "A time limit for how long agentgateway will wait for a response from a backend before considering the request failed. Timeouts can be configured at the request or backend level."

Mirroring:
  short: "A resiliency feature that sends a copy of requests to an additional backend for testing or analysis, without affecting the primary request flow."

Circuit Breaker:
  short: "A resiliency pattern that stops sending requests to a failing backend temporarily, allowing it to recover. Circuit breakers help prevent cascading failures."

CEL (Common Expression Language):
  short: "A simple expression language used throughout agentgateway to enable flexible configuration. CEL expressions can access request context, JWT claims, and other variables to make dynamic decisions."

ExtProc (External Processing):
  short: "An advanced filter that allows arbitrary modifications to HTTP requests and responses using an external gRPC processing server. ExtProc is API-compatible with Envoy's External Processing service."

Quota:
  short: "A limit on the amount of resources (requests, tokens, etc.) that can be consumed within a specific time period. Quotas are enforced through rate limiting policies."

STDIO (Standard Input/Output):
  short: "A connection method for MCP servers that communicates through standard input and output streams. STDIO is commonly used for local MCP server processes."

Multiplex:
  short: "A connection method for MCP servers that allows multiple MCP sessions to share a single transport connection, improving efficiency."

OpenAPI:
  short: "A specification for describing RESTful APIs. Agentgateway can connect to MCP servers that expose an OpenAPI specification."

Provider:
  short: "A service that provides LLM capabilities, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Azure. Agentgateway supports multiple LLM providers and can route to different providers based on configuration."

Inference:
  short: "The process of generating predictions or responses from a trained machine learning model. In the context of agentgateway, inference refers to LLM API calls for generating text or other outputs."
