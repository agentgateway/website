A2A:
  short: "Agent-to-Agent Protocol for secure, policy-driven communication across agents."
  

Agentgateway:
  short: "An open-source data plane optimized for agentic AI connectivity."
  

Agents:
  short: "Autonomous AI components that interact with MCP tools, services, and other agents."
  

API Gateway:
  short: "A centralized entry point that manages, secures, and routes API traffic."
  

Control Plane:
  short: "Components that manage and distribute configuration and policies to the data plane."
  

Data Plane:
  short: "Proxies (agentgateway) that process live network traffic per configuration from the control plane."
  

Large Language Model (LLM):
  short: "Pre-trained language models used for natural language tasks. LLM traffic can be managed via agentgateway."
  

LLM Gateway / AI Gateway:
  short: "A gateway pattern for managing LLM/AI traffic, often served by agentgateway."
  

MCP (Model Context Protocol):
  short: "Protocol for exchanging model context and metadata between LLM gateways, agents, and tools."
  

Observability (Logging, Monitoring, Tracing):
  short: "Telemetry systems (logs, metrics, traces) used to monitor agentgateway."
  

Proxy:
  short: "Agentgateway-based data plane process that terminates and forwards traffic."
  

Rate Limiting:
  short: "Policies that control request rates to protect backends and enforce quotas."
  

Resiliency:
  short: "Features that improve reliability, such as retries, timeouts, and circuit breakers."
  

Security:
  short: "Authentication, authorization, encryption and other protections for traffic."
  

Traffic Management:
  short: "Features to control routing, transformations, load balancing, and traffic shaping."
