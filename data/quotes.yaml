    The future won’t be built by standalone agents, MCP servers or LLMs — it’s
    shaped by their interconnection and ability to work together seamlessly. To
    unlock their full potential, we must apply policies, ensure control and
    maintain clear visibility into their interactions. This is where
    agentgateway plays a pivotal role — bridging not only agent-to-agent (A2A)
    communication but also agent-to-MCP servers, filling a critical gap in the
    ecosystem. I look forward to seeing the project’s continued momentum within
    the Linux Foundation.

    AI agents are rapidly transforming how enterprises work and innovate. To
    adopt them responsibly at scale, organizations need open and interoperable
    gateways that provide governance, visibility, and security. Agentgateway
    delivers the foundation enterprises need. I’m excited to see the community
    come together to accelerate the open foundation our customers need to scale
    AI on cloud platforms like CoreWeave.

    Agentic AI demands purpose-built infrastructure, not just another software
    layer. This requires rethinking compute, storage, and data movement from the
    ground up, so retrofitting legacy systems doesn’t work. The agentgateway
    project is a solid step toward that future. We’re happy to see it hosted by
    the Linux Foundation, where open source and community can drive the adoption
    and longevity that AI infrastructure requires.

    We are excited to welcome the agentgateway project to the Linux Foundation,
    ensuring that best practices for agentic workflows remain free and open to
    all. Agentgateway complements emerging specifications like A2A and MCP, and
    offers scalable, specification-aligned infrastructure for agent communication
    thereby empowering customers and developers to build robust agentic
    workflows across platforms.

    I’m excited to see Solo.io donate the agentgateway project to the Linux
    Foundation. Open sourcing an AI-native connectivity solution that understands
    MCP and A2A is a big win for the community. It helps us scale AI
    responsibly, with the security, flexibility, and governance we need in the
    real world.

    Building reliable AI agents is a challenge, especially when every step
    involves non-deterministic calls to LLMs, tools, and autonomous agents.
    Agentgateway’s integration with OpenTelemetry provides a robust foundation
    for observability, allowing us to treat each request-response pair as an
    evaluable unit. This capability is crucial for ensuring system-level
    accuracy and trustworthiness, paving the way for a true ‘AI mesh’ that
    empowers teams to scale, secure and optimize their AI workflows.

    One of the biggest open security problems today is how to do MCP security
    effectively. While there are a lot of problems in this space that the
    community doesn’t know how to address, the agentgateway project provides a
    first step toward addressing some of the important issues with basic
    role-based access control and visibility of actions to MCP servers. I look
    forward to seeing how this project adapts and evolves to handle the complex,
    evolving threats in this space under open source governance.

    The rapid evolution of the AI landscape demands robust, vendor-neutral
    infrastructure for how agents communicate with each other and with external
    tools. Without it, we risk stifling innovation and adoption. The
    agentgateway project, hosted by the Linux Foundation, is a crucial step in
    creating that common ground. We are excited to partner with Solo.io and
    support a community-driven foundation for the future of interoperable AI.
