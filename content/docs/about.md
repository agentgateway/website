Agent proxy is an open source, highly available, and highly scalable data plane that provides AI  connectivity in any environment. With agentproxy, agent and tool developers can easily develop, connect, discover, integrate, and secure agents and tools with the built-in self-service developer portal. 




## Benefits

* **Highly performant**: Agent proxy is written in Rust and designed to handle any scale. 
* **Platform-agnostic**: Agent proxy can run in any environment, from bare metal, virtual machine, containers, and Kubernetes. 
* **Dynamic configuration updates** Agent proxy can be updated via an xDS interface without any downtime. 
* **Security with RBAC**: Agent proxy supports a robust RBAC system that is focused on allowing you to control access to MCP and A2A targets. 


* **Multi Tenant**: agentproxy supports multiple tenants, each with their own set of resources and users.
* **Legacy API Support**: agentproxy can transform legacy APIs into MCP resources. Currently supports OpenAPI. (gRPC coming soon)
