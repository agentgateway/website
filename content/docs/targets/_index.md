A target represents a destination for which you want the agentproxy to proxy traffic for. Agentproxy is designed to enable AI connectivity for tools and agents, and therefore supports various protocols to interact with targets, including: 

* [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/docs/targets/mcp)
* [MCP multiplexing](/docs/targets/multiplex)
* [Agent-to-agent (A2A)](/docs/targets/a2a)
* [OpenAPI](/docs/targets/openapi)
