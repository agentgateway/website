## 🔥 Breaking changes {#v16-breaking-changes}

### `agctl catalog import` merges multiple sources and tags Bedrock models by default

<!-- ref: https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/pull/3275 -->

The `agctl catalog import` command used to accept a single pricing source. The `--source` flag now takes a comma-separated list, and the sources merge in the order that you list them, so a later source overlays an earlier one. Three sources are available: `models.dev`, `aws-bedrock-mantle`, and `github`.

| Flag | 1.5.x | 1.6.x |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--source` value | A single source | A comma-separated list, merged in order |
| `--source` omitted | Imports `models.dev` | Imports `models.dev,aws-bedrock-mantle` |
| `--source models.dev` | Imports `models.dev` | Unchanged, but no Bedrock tags are added |
| `--source aws-bedrock-mantle` | Rejected as an unsupported source | Tags Amazon Bedrock models, and contributes no rates |
| `--source github` | Rejected as an unsupported source | Imports the curated catalog that the agentgateway project publishes at [agentgateway.dev/model-catalog](https://agentgateway.dev/model-catalog) |

Rates are unaffected by the new default, because `models.dev` is still the only source in it that prices models. The catalog file format does not change either, so a catalog that you generated earlier still loads.

What does change is that a default import now writes tags onto the Amazon Bedrock models. The `aws-bedrock-mantle` source reads the AWS model cards and records which endpoint serves each model, `runtime` or `mantle`, along with the request formats that the Mantle endpoint accepts. Two of those tag families feed proxy behavior:

- The `runtime` and `mantle` tags decide which Bedrock endpoint a chat request takes, under the new `bedrockEndpointPreference` setting on the Bedrock provider.
- The chat format tags, such as `anthropic_messages` and `openai_responses`, replace the built-in list of formats that the proxy accepts for a tagged model. A request in a format that is not tagged then fails with an unsupported conversion error.

**Actions to take**: If you regenerate your catalog on a schedule and you route Bedrock traffic, regenerate it once by hand first and compare the `tags` entries under the `aws.bedrock` provider against the formats that your clients send, because a tagged model no longer accepts the formats that are missing from its tag list. To keep the 1.5.x output, pin the source with `--source models.dev`. For the flags, see the [`agctl catalog import`]({{< link-hextra path="/reference/agctl/agctl-catalog-import/" >}}) reference. For the endpoint setting, see [Bedrock Mantle]({{< link-hextra path="/integrations/llm/providers/bedrock/#bedrock-mantle" >}}).

## 🌟 New features {#v16-new-features}

### Operations {#v16-features-operations}

#### OpenTelemetry field names for stdout access logs {#v16-access-log-preset}

<!-- ref: https://github.com/agentgateway/agentgateway/pull/3182 -->

The stdout access log uses short, human-oriented field names, such as `http.path`. A new `preset` field on the access log policy selects a built-in field set instead. Set `preset: otel` to rename the built-in HTTP fields to their [OpenTelemetry semantic convention](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/http/http-spans/) equivalents, such as `url.path`, and to emit `network.protocol.version` as `1.1` rather than `HTTP/1.1`. The preset also adds `url.scheme`, and it adds `server.port` and `url.query` when the request supplies them. Note that `url.path` carries the path only: a query string that used to appear on `http.path` now appears on `url.query` instead.

Only the built-in HTTP field set is renamed. The `gen_ai.*` and `mcp.*` fields already use semantic convention names, fields that you add yourself keep the names that you give them, and an OTLP export is unaffected.

For the field rename table and an example, see [Use OpenTelemetry field names]({{< link-hextra path="/documentation/observability/access-logs/view/#preset" >}}).
