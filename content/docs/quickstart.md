description: Deploy a basic agentproxy on your machine.

Get started with agentproxy, an open source, highly available, and highly scalable data plane that brings AI connectivity for agents and tools. To learn more about agentproxy, see the [About](/docs/about) section. 

## About this guide

In this guide, you learn how to use the agentproxy to proxy requests to an open source MCP test server that exposes multiple MCP test tools. 

{{< reuse-image src="img/quickstart.svg" width="500px" >}}

You complete the following tasks: 
* Install the agentproxy binary on your local machine. 
* Create an agentproxy configuration that proxies requests to multiple tools that are exposed on an open source MCP test server, `server-everything`. 
* Test access to the `everything_echo` MCP tool. 
* Explore the agentproxy UI. 


## Step 1: Install the binary


1. Download the agentproxy binary and install it. 
   ```sh
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentproxy-dev/agentproxy/refs/heads/main/common/scripts/get-agentproxy | bash
   ```
   
   Example output: 
   ```
     % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

2. Verify that agentproxy is installed. 
   ```sh
   agentproxy --version
   ```
   
## Step 2: Set up an agentproxy

1. Create a listener and target configuration for your agentproxy. In this example, you use a configuration file to configure the agentproxy, but you can also use the agentproxy UI or admin API to configure these components. For examples, see the [Listeners](/docs/listeners) and [Targets](/docs/targets) guides. 
   
   The agentproxy in this example is configured as follows: 
   * **Listener**: An SSE listener is configured and exposed on port 3000. 
   * **Target**: The agentproxy targets a sample, open source MCP test server, `server-everything`. The server runs the entire MCP stack in a single process and can be used to test, develop, or demo MCP environments. 
   
     To run the server, you use the standard input/output (`stdio`) capability of the agentproxy, which allows you to pass in the command and command arguments that you want to use. In this example, the `npx` command is used. The `npx` command utility lets you to run a Node.js package (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything`) without installing it. If you do not have `npx` on your machine, follow the [instructions to install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
   ```sh
   cat <<EOF > config.json
   {{< github url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agentproxy-dev/agentproxy/refs/heads/main/examples/basic/config.json" >}}
   EOF
   ```

2. Run the agentproxy. 
   ```sh
   agentproxy -f config.json
   ```
   
   Example output: 
   ```
   2025-04-16T20:19:36.449164Z  INFO agentproxy: Reading config from file: basic.json
   2025-04-16T20:19:36.449580Z  INFO insert_target: agentproxy::xds: inserted target: everything
   2025-04-16T20:19:36.449595Z  INFO agentproxy::r#static: local config initialized num_mcp_targets=1 num_a2a_targets=0
   2025-04-16T20:19:36.449874Z  INFO agentproxy::inbound: serving sse on [::]:3000
   ```

## Step 3: Access an MCP tool

1. Run the MCP inspector, a debugging and visualization tool for the Model Context Protocol.
   ```sh
   SERVER_PORT=9000 npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector 
   ```
   
   Example output: 
   ```
   Starting MCP inspector...
   Proxy server listening on port 9000
   New SSE connection
   Query parameters: { transportType: 'sse', url: 'http://localhost:3000/sse' }
   SSE transport: url=http://localhost:3000/sse, headers=Accept,authorization
   Connected to SSE transport
   Connected MCP client to backing server transport
   Created web app transport
   Created web app transport
   Set up MCP proxy

   üîç MCP Inspector is up and running at http://localhost:5173?proxyPort=9000 üöÄ
   ```
   
2. Open the MCP inspector at the address from the output of the previous command, such as [http://localhost:5173?proxyPort=9000](http://localhost:5173?proxyPort=9000). 

3. Connect to the agentproxy. 
   1. Switch the **Transport Type** to `SSE`.
   2. Change the URL to `http://localhost:3000/sse`, which represents the address that the agentproxy is exposed on. 
   3. Click **Connect** to connect to the agentproxy. 

4. Access an MCP tool. 
   1. In the MCP inspector, go to **Tools**.
   2. Click **List Tools** to show the tools that the agentproxy has access to from the `server-everything` target that you configured earlier.
   3. Select the **everything_echo** tool. 
   4. In the **message** field, enter any string, such as `This is a sample agentproxy setup.`. 
   5. Click **Run Tool** to execute the tool. 
   6. Verify that your string is echoed back.

## Step 4: Explore the UI

The agentproxy comes with a built-in UI that you can use to review and update your agentproxy configuration in-flight. Configuration updates are available immediately and do not require a restart of the agentproxy.  

1. Open the built-in [agentproxy UI](http://localhost:19000). 

2. Verify that you see the listener and the MCP target that you set up earlier. 
   {{< reuse-image src="img/agentproxy-ui-home.png" >}}
   
3. Go to the [**Listener** overview](http://localhost:19000/ui/listeners/) and review your listener configuration. 

   {{< reuse-image src="img/agentproxy-ui-listener-basic.png" >}}
   
4. Go to the [**Targets** overview](http://localhost:19000/ui/targets/) and review your target configuration.

## Next

With you agentproxy up and running, you can now explore the following tasks: 

* [Configure other targets](/docs/targets), such as multiple MCP servers, an A2A agent, or an OpenAPI spec. 
* [Secure your agentproxy setup](/docs/security), such as by setting up a TLS listener, JWT authentication, and RBAC policies to control access to tools and agents. 
* [Explore metrics and traces](/docs/observability) that the agentproxy emits so that you can monitor the traffic that goes through your agentproxy.
