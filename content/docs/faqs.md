## How does agentgateway relate to kgateway?

While you can manually deploy agentgateway proxies in any environment, you might want a more declarative way to define your agentgateway proxy and deploy it, especially in cloud-native environments, such as Kubernetes. 

The [kgateway open source project](https://kgateway.dev) is the recommended control plane to quickly spin up and manage the lifecycle of agentgateway proxies in Kubernetes clusters. In addition, you can leverage kgateway's traffic management, resiliency, and security policies to further protect your agentgateway proxy and make it more robust. 

Kgateway passes conformance tests for the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) and [Inference Extensions](https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/) projects so you can use the standards that you are familiar with to configure agentgateway. 

For more information about how to deploy agentgateway with kgateway, see the [kgateway documentation](https://kgateway.dev/docs/agentgateway/). 

## What's the difference between agentgateway and kagent? 

Agentgateway governs agent-to-tool, agent-to-agent, and agent-to-LLM communication ensuring that these components can securely and reliably talk to each other and exchange data. However, agentgateway assumes that the MCP servers, tools, and agents that you want to access already exist in your environment.

Thatâ€™s where [kagent](https://kagent.dev) comes in. With kagent, you can quickly develop, build, and run MCP servers and agents directly in Kubernetes. Kagent automates complex DevOps and platform engineering operations for you with out-of-the-box agents and tools, intelligent workflows, and built-in troubleshooting. 

Together, kagent and agentgateway give you all the tools to successfully build a production-ready agentic AI environment that is scalable, reliable, and secure.
