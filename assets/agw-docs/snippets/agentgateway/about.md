[Agentgateway](https://agentgateway.dev/) is an open source, AI-first data plane that provides connectivity for agents, MCP tools, LLMs, and inferences in any environment. In Kubernetes environments, you can use {{< reuse "/agw-docs/snippets/kgateway.md" >}} as the control plane to quickly spin up and manage the lifecycle of agentgateway proxies. The control plane translates Kubernetes Gateway API and {{< reuse "agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway.md" >}}'s Kubernetes custom resources such as {{< reuse "/agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway/agentgatewaypolicy.md" >}} and {{< reuse "/agw-docs/snippets/agentgateway/agentgatewaybackend.md" >}} into proxy configuration for the data plane.
