While MCP and A2A define the RPC communication protocol for agents and tools, they currently do not address real-world, enterprise-level concerns.

Agents typically do not operate in isolation. Instead, they interact with each other (agent-to-agent), with internal systems (agent-to-tool), and external or foundational models (agent-to-LLM). These interactions are often dynamic, multi-modal, and span organizational and data boundaries. 

Such long-lived interactivity creates new vectors for risk and complexity, including: 
* **Security**: How to handle authentication, authorization, and auditing of agent interactions across tools and services? 
* **Governance**: How to enforce policies across autonomous workflows, such as data residency or access control? 
* **Observability**: How to gain visibility into what agents are doing, when, and why? 
* **Scalability and performance**: How to ensure low latency while securely handling retries, timeouts, and failures? 

Agentgateway is designed to tackle these challenges at its core with built-in security, governance, and observability for all MCP and A2A communication between agents, tools, and LLMs.
