With agentic artificial intelligence (AI) changing the way organizations build and deliver applications, organizations face the challenge of rapidly adopting new technologies and interoperability protocols to connect agents and tools in fragmented environments. Because AI agents and tools can be built with different frameworks, and access different APIs and data sources, standardizing the way agents and tools communicate with each other is essential to further accelerate agent development. 

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) and [Agent-to-Agent (A2A)](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A) are the leading protocols for enabling communication between agents and tools. MCP helps to retrieve and exchange context with Large Language Models (LLMs) and connect LLMs to tools. A2A on the other hand solves for long-running tasks and state management across multiple agents. MCP and A2A are both JSON-RPC protocols that define the structure of how an agent describes what it wants to do, how it calls tools, and how it hands off tasks to other agents.
